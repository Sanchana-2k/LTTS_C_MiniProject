## Challenges Faced and How Was It Overcome

1. Inputing char for int in while(1) loop lead to infinite loop -> got value as fgets
2. Including files -> later resolved

## Project Enhancements carried out
Variable | Bug | Fix
--- | --- | ----
input_value | Character inputs was considered 0 | Indicated as invalid and user asked to re-enter
input_value | Negative inputs were accepted by considering their absolute values | Indicating metric cannot be negative, user asked to re-enter
choice_of_quantity, index_of_input, number_of_output_conversions, array_of_output_index[i] | fseek to flush stdin, so next variable does not take values from previous input was not working in linux | Buffer size increased to fit accidental extra values
choice_of_quantity, index_of_input, number_of_output_conversions, array_of_output_index[i] | only 1st digit was considered for index, thus, accidental 123 input is considered index 1 | Fixed by prompting user to re-enter input within the range

### Miscellaneous
